Install Python packages for Redis Gears

Disclaimer:
This instructions are provided as a work around and not considered official, any use of this is the user responsibility.

Notes:
This doc is assuming the following:
•	Redis Gears is already installed on the Redis enterprise cluster.
•	The Redis gears Python version is 3.7 (if not the sidecar container image should be changed).

Instructions:
a.	edit the gears.yaml, replace the <Python packages> with the Python packages that should be installed.
The packages must be separated by a ' ' (space).
For example to install the packages pytz version 2021.3 and kubernetes the yaml should be:
```
...
      - name: "GEARS_PACKAGES"
        value: "pytz==2021.3 kubernetes"
...
```
b.	Run the kubectl patch command  on your cluster with the modified gears.yaml from the previous step, replace the <REC name> with the name of your Redis enterprise cluster:
kubectl patch rec  <REC name> --type merge --patch "$(cat gears.yaml)"
c.	Wait until all the Redis enterprise nodes are restarted with the new configurations.
d.	Add the below code snippet in the top of your Redis gears Python function that wants to use the installed package/s:
```
import sys
if '/opt/redislabs/gears-packages' not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append('/opt/redislabs/gears-packages')
# Your code below...
```
