                                Using "http://" is NOT recommended for production environments

                                from the REC Cluster Manager UI service: - If the UI

                                the load balancer address is used. - Otherwise, the
                                cluster-internal DNS name is used (e.g., rec-ui.svc.cluster.local).
                                - The port defaults to 8443 if not specified. Usage
                                guidelines: - For LoadBalancer services: Leave this
                                field blank to use the default REC UI service, or set
                                it explicitly to the LoadBalancer address for custom
                                services. - For Ingress: Set this to the ingress hostname
                                and port (typically 443), e.g., "https://redis-ui.example.com:443".'

                        When bdb_name is used, the database name will be also used for the service name.
                        When redis-port is used, the service will be named redis-<port>.

                        that are required for the rigger deployment pod. Pod attributes
                        managed by the operator might override these settings (Containers,
                        serviceAccountName, podTolerations, ImagePullSecrets, nodeSelector,
                        PriorityClassName, PodSecurityContext). Also make sure the attributes are supported
                        by the K8s version running on the cluster - the operator does
                        not validate that.
