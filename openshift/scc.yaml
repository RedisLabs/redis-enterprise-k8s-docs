  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/description: redis-enterprise-scc is the minimal SCC needed to run Redis Enterprise nodes on Kubernetes.
      It provides the same features as restricted-v2 SCC, but allows pods to enable the SYS_RESOURCE capability,
      which is required by Redis Enterprise nodes to manage file descriptor limits and OOM scores for database shards.
      Additionally, it requires pods to run as UID/GID 1001, which are the UID/GID used within the Redis Enterprise node containers.
