                        the client source IP address. This is required because the Redis server uses the client''s
                        source IP to construct the CLUSTER SHARDS/SLOTS response - returning pod IPs for internal
                        clients (matching podCIDRs) or load balancer addresses for external clients.
                        On cloud platforms, this typically requires configuring the load balancer to preserve source IPs.'

                                - The port defaults to 8443 if not specified. Usage
                                guidelines: - For LoadBalancer services: Leave this

                                and port (typically 443), e.g., "https://redis-ui.example.com:443".'

                    certificates are updated on the local participating cluster. When
                    a change is detected, the operator automatically executes a CRDB
                    force update (equivalent to 'crdb-cli crdb update --force'), which
                    synchronizes the certificate changes to all participating clusters,
                    preventing sync issues. This eliminates the manual step of running
                    crdb-cli commands when rotating certificates in Active-Active deployments
                    on Kubernetes.
